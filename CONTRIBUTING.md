# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve these guides!

## Ground rules
- Prefer **short runnable scripts** over long prose.
- Keep commands **copy‑pasteable**.
- Mark campus‑specific notes with a callout block: `> [Campus‑note: 42 Lyon] ...`
- Avoid secrets/PII.

## How to contribute
1. Fork and create a branch: `feat/<short-name>`
2. Make changes in `docs/` or `scripts/`
3. Ensure examples run end‑to‑end
4. Open a PR with a clear summary + screenshots if useful

## Style
- Use headings `# H1`, `## H2`, `### H3`
- Include TL;DR at the top when helpful
- Prefer bash over zsh/fish for portability
